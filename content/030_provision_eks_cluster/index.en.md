We are ready to get started!  The next step will guide you through creating Terraform files, which we use throughout the workshop and gradually modify.

TODO: change the diagram

In this section, we are going to manually create our Terraform project step by step.

It is recommanded to click on **Next** or **Manual Setup (recommended)** and go to Manual Setup.

If you want, you can also take a shortcut by going to **Skip Manual Cluster Provisioning (shortcut)** directly.
